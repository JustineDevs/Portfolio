# Overview
I am Justine, a software developer specializing in blockchain and web technologies with a strong portfolio of projects.
As a Solidity developer in a 3-member team, I contributed to building HyperionKit - a developer infrastructure toolkit. Despite being a beginner in smart contracts, I learned through collaborative coding and helped achieve our first hackathon victory!

My experience also covers front-end projects, responsive web apps, user authentication systems, advanced crypto trading automation, and decentralized governance tools.

Since 2022, I have been an active Web3 community moderator and professional moderator, evolving from volunteer roles to paid projects. Strong problem solver and communicator, aiming to expand client-facing and IT infrastructure skills.
